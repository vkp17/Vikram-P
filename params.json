{"name":"Vikram P","tagline":"\"Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.\" ~FDR","body":"## Who am I?\r\nMy name is Vikram, college bound student and aspiring engineer and programmer. Since the early days of my life I've asked countless questions, usually about technology and how things worked. From this curiosity spawned a quest to answer my questions, developing a love for problem solving and finding creative solutions. Perhaps this is why I take so much joy in my work with robotics, where we are given a task to accomplish and must design and construct a robot that can do said task. But it was this love of robotics that made me ask one more question: How does the robot know what to do? Of course, the answer is that it is programmed to do whatever it is told to do. This fascinated me and I started to explore the field of computer science and programming. I feel that a career in either engineering or programming is the one for me.\r\n\r\n## What have I done?\r\nIn my high school, I am the Vice President of the computer science club, Captain of the cyber security competition team, and a member of the electrical subteam of the robotics team.\r\n\r\n## What do I think college will be like?\r\nTo be honest, I don't know what the next 4 years at college have in store for me, but I am looking forward to meeting people, visiting new places, exploring opportunities, and receiving a great undergraduate education.\r\n\r\n## How can you contact me?\r\nYou can email me at vkp1700@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n### [My Resume](https://github.com/vkp17)\r\n### [My Github](https://github.com/vkp17)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
